### Milestone 1 (Nov Week 1): Project Setup & Initial Proposal

- **What we'll do:**
  - Write the initial project description and problem statement.
  - Draft basic data models (Users, Items, Borrow Records).
  - Set up the GitHub repository and add team collaborators.
  - Fork repositories for individual development.
  - Finalize the project topic: Equipment Borrow and Return API.
- **Deliverables:**
  - GitHub repository created with collaborators.
  - Updated README.md with Problem Statement, Needs Analysis, and Data Models.
  - An initial `api.yaml` file (or Postman collection) that lists all planned endpoints (e.g., `/users`, `/items`).
- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] Patrice Jessie Ricarte created repo
  - [ ] Added collaborators (Gaston, Durano, Loking)
  - [ ] Members forked repository
  - [ ] Updated README.md
  - [ ] Wrote project intro + problem + solution
  - [ ] Added Data Models draft
  - [ ] Create `api.yaml` and add endpoints
  - [ ] Commit and push all files to GitHub

### Milestone 2 (Nov Week 2): API Foundation & Basic Documentation

- **What we'll do:**
  - Initialize Flask project (virtual environment, dependencies).
  - Set up SQLite
  - Implement basic endpoints:
    - /items → list all items
    - /items/add → add new equipment
  - Start writing OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation.
  - Improve Git flow using feature branches and organized commits.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Running Flask server with list and create working for Items.
  - api_documentation.yaml (or Postman collection) with request/response examples.
  - README updated with setup instructions.
- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] Virtual environment created
  - [ ] Flask + database installed
  - [ ] /items GET implemented
  - [ ] /items/add POST implemented
  - [ ] Swagger/OpenAPI file created
  - [ ] Added examples (JSON) to docs
  - [ ] Updated GitHub repository

### Milestone 3 (Nov Week 3): Full Backend API

- **What you’ll do:**
  - Complete remaining CRUD and special actions (e.g., claim item).
  - Add validation and error responses (400/404) consistently.
  - Seed script with sample data for demos.
  - Update OpenAPI to match actual responses and edge cases.
- **Deliverables:**
  - All planned endpoints implemented and tested locally.
  - Seed script and instructions in README.
  - OpenAPI spec validated in Swagger Editor (no schema errors).
- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] All endpoints done
  - [ ] Validation + errors consistent
  - [ ] Seed data added
  - [ ] OpenAPI validated

### Milestone 4 (Nov Week 4): Frontend Integration

- **What you’ll do:**
  - Build a simple UI (Plain JS or React) to call your API (list/create/claim).
  - Handle loading and error states on the frontend.
  - If presenting remotely, prepare ngrok for HTTPS URL (optional).
- **Deliverables:**
  - Frontend that demonstrates key API flows.
  - Instructions in README on how to run frontend + connect to API.
- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] Frontend lists data
  - [ ] Frontend creates data
  - [ ] Frontend handles errors/loading
  - [ ] Run steps documented

### Milestone 5 (Optional, Dec Week 1): Containerization (Docker) for Easy Setup

- **Why:** Make your app run the same on any machine.
- **What you’ll do:**
  - Write a `Dockerfile` for the backend.
  - Use a volume for SQLite file if you want to keep data.
  - Add `docker run` commands to README.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Buildable image and instructions to run.
- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] Dockerfile builds
  - [ ] App runs in container
  - [ ] README has Docker steps

### Final (Dec Week 2): Full Demo & Presentation

- **What you’ll do:**
  - Present problem, solution, and a live walkthrough of API + frontend.
  - Show OpenAPI docs and how they match the implementation.
  - Share repository link and quickstart steps.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Slide or short doc with key points.
  - Live demo script (steps you’ll follow during presentation).
- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] Slides ready
  - [ ] Demo data seeded
  - [ ] Backup plan (screenshots/videos) prepared
